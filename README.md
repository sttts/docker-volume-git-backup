[![Pulls](https://img.shields.io/docker/pulls/fvanderbiest/volume-git-backup.svg)](https://hub.docker.com/r/fvanderbiest/volume-git-backup/)

This repository is the source of the [fvanderbiest/volume-git-backup](https://hub.docker.com/r/fvanderbiest/volume-git-backup/) image on Docker Hub.
The image provides an easy way to `git commit` a docker volume every time a file is updated.
Feel free to use it if it suits your needs. Contributions welcomed.

This image expects to find the volume mounted in `rw` mode on `/var/local/data`.

The file to watch for changes should also be contained in this directory.
Internally, we're using `inotifywait` to watch the file.

When change is detected, the script performs the commit and optionally pushes to a remote repository.

At startup, if a remote repository is configured a clone of this repository is
done in the volume. If volume is not empty, you will need to set FORCE_CLONE var
to 'yes' to force a cleanup of the volume. If the volume is already verionned
(contains a `.git` folder) then git remote is updated and local repository is updated
to the last commit of configured branch.

Example usage:
```yaml
sync:
  image: fvanderbiest/volume-git-backup
  environment:
    WATCH_FILE: global.xml
    GIT_COMMIT_MESSAGE: printf "updateSequence "; grep updateSequence global.xml|sed -e 's#.*ce>\(.*\)</up.*#\1#'
    GIT_USERNAME: fvanderbiest
    GIT_EMAIL: my.email@provider.com
  volumes:
    - geoserver_datadir:/var/local/data:rw
```

Required environment:
 * `WATCH_FILE`: file to watch (path relative to volume root)
 * `GIT_COMMIT_MESSAGE`: string or expression evaluated in the volume to provide a commit message
 * `GIT_USERNAME`: git username for commit
 * `GIT_EMAIL`: git email for commit

To push to a repository, these additional variables are required:
 * `REMOTE_NAME`: name of the git remote, eg `origin`
 * `REMOTE_URL`: git repository URL, eg `https://github.com/fvanderbiest/playground.git`

Optional environment:
 * `REMOTE_BRANCH`: Remote branch to use. Defaults to master.
 * `FORCE_CLONE`: Delete volume content before cloning remote repository
 * `REPO_DIR`: The target directory where the repository is checked out. This defaults to `/var/local/data`.
 * `RECONCILE_SECONDS`: Seconds after which the current state is pushed, in case a change event was missed. Default to 300s, can be disabled by setting it to `0`.

To use SSH authentication to access remote repository, one of following
variables must be set:
 * `GIT_RSA_DEPLOY_KEY`: Private RSA key to use (eg: [GitHub deploy keys](https://developer.github.com/guides/managing-deploy-keys/))
 * `GIT_RSA_DEPLOY_KEY_FILE`: Path to a file containing the private RSA key to use


**WARNING**: the `git push` command performs a **forced update** to the `master` branch, which might result in **data loss** !

Optional:
 * `SLEEPING_TIME`: if `WATCH_FILE` does not exist at startup, time to wait before a new check starts. Defaults to 1 sec.


# testing

In the `tests` folder there's a [docker-compose](tests/docker-compose.yml) file to easily create a testing environment.

The Dockerfile in the `tests/geoserver_mock` directory creates an image whose purpose is to periodically update the contents of a docker volume.
It kind of mimics what [GeoServer](http://geoserver.org/) does to its config directory and is a lightweight alternative.
